## 2024-05-23 - Accessibility contentDescriptions in Jetpack Compose
**Learning:** Setting `contentDescription = null` on an `Icon` in Jetpack Compose means the icon won't be read out directly. However, for interactive buttons (like `TvIconButton` or custom components based on `Button`), this means there's no semantic label if it only contains the icon!
**Action:** When adding informative icons to clickable containers, ALWAYS set a `contentDescription` referencing a localized string in `strings.xml`. Ensure `contentDescription = null` is only used for purely decorative icons.

## 2026-09-06 - Replacing custom Empty States with TvEmptyState
**Learning:** Found custom empty states implementations across the app, such as in `DownloadsScreen.kt`. Using custom empty states often skips critical built-in accessibility features (like `liveRegion = LiveRegionMode.Polite`) and leads to design inconsistencies.
**Action:** Replaced `DownloadsEmptyState` with the standard `TvEmptyState` component. Moving forward, prioritize standard empty state components like `TvEmptyState` or `AppMessageState` which enforce cohesive design and accessibility semantics automatically.
## 2026-09-13 - Replaced text with semantic pause icon\n**Learning:** Accessibility text used visually as an icon causes screen-reader issues and inconsistencies in the UI representation.\n**Action:** Replaced Text("II") with Icons.Default.Pause to correctly represent the icon.

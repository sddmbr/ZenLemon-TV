## 2024-05-23 - Accessibility contentDescriptions in Jetpack Compose
**Learning:** Setting `contentDescription = null` on an `Icon` in Jetpack Compose means the icon won't be read out directly. However, for interactive buttons (like `TvIconButton` or custom components based on `Button`), this means there's no semantic label if it only contains the icon!
**Action:** When adding informative icons to clickable containers, ALWAYS set a `contentDescription` referencing a localized string in `strings.xml`. Ensure `contentDescription = null` is only used for purely decorative icons.
